This app will allow viewing of static images from webcams or other internet locations.  It supports basic and digest authentication methods (in both cases URLs can be entered as http[s]://username:password@camera_site.com/path/).  It will also refresh the images with a frequency specified in the Settings menu.  Image URLs can be edited by pressing on the image nickname.  Images can be deleted from the list with a long press.  Pressing on an image will make the image full screen.  Long pressing on an image will save the image to the system Pictures folder.  

This app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.
